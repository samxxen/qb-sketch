Sketch and Send is a highly-configurable FiveM plugin that allows users to communicate through sketching drawings and sending them to fellow members
with the option to use ACE permissions to enhance security.

## Prerequisites
- [imgbb API key](https://api.imgbb.com)




## ImgBB Setup
- Create an account with ImgBB
- Goto https://api.imgbb.com/
- Click "Get API key"
- Copy your API key into the value of `Config.imgbbApiKey`
- Go to your profile
- Set your profile to private (in case of NSFW content being drawn)

### ImgBB Note
ImgBB may rate limit you and return status code 400 if too many sketches are made at once, in that case please just wait patiently in order for everything to
return to normal. I highly recommend restricting sketches to certain ACE groups to avoid this.
